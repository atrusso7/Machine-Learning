# Praetorian Machine Learning Challenge
From Praetorian website:

We see huge benefits of machine learning in the field of computer security. Do you?

Much of the work we do on a daily basis can be automated and classified by a machine, leaving us to focus on more interesting and challenging problems. One stunning example is the automated binary exploitation and patching research funded by DARPA for the Cyber Grand Challenge. Problems like these are the stepping stones that will lead us to a future of automated computer security.

The crux of the challenge is to build a classifier that can automatically identify and categorize the instruction set architecture of a random binary blob. Train a machine learning classifier to identify the architecture of a binary blob given a list of possible architectures. We currently support twelve architectures, including: avr, alphaev56, arm, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390, sh4, sparc, x86_64, and xtensa.
